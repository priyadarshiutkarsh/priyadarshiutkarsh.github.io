About Me
======
Here is Utkarsh Priyadarshi (He/Him).

I am an undergraduate student in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, currently conducting research under Dr. Adam Ross Nelson through the Wisconsin Undergraduate Research in Data Science program.

Previously, I worked at a stealth AI lab on activation maximization and sparse autoencoders, interned at IBM where I developed a DCGAN for face generation, and contributed to agent risk modeling through the Supervised Program for Alignment Research (SPAR Summer 2024).

If you’re interested in any of my work or ideas, I’m always open to meaningful discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — upriyadarshi [at] wisc [dot] edu
